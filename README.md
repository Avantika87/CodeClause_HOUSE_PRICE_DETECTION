## What It Does:
This ML or SML model uses historical data to forecast future price changes.It provide insights into whether house price is likely to rise, fall or remain stable.It can be used by Analysts and investors to make informed decisions about buying, selling, or holding house assets.However, predicting financial markets is complex and uncertain, so these models should be used alongside other analyses for more comprehensive decision-making.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing <br>
3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Wrangling <br>
4Ô∏è‚É£ Dataset Balancing & Scaling <br>
5Ô∏è‚É£ Machine Learning Model Training and Evaluation


## Prerequisites:
Before the hacknight, it is advised to have a ready-to-use toolchain and development environment.A recommended set of tools contains : <br>


1Ô∏è‚É£ `Python`<br>
2Ô∏è‚É£ `scikit-learn` / `sklearn`<br>
3Ô∏è‚É£ `Pandas`<br>
4Ô∏è‚É£ `NumPy`<br>
5Ô∏è‚É£ `Seaborn`<br>
6Ô∏è‚É£ `matplotlib` <br>
7Ô∏è‚É£ An environment to work in - something like  `colab` or `Jupyter` <br>


For Linux people, your package manager should be able to handle all of this. If it somehow can't, see if you can at least install Python and pip and then use pip to install the above packages.

## Dataset:

> You can collect raw dataset from [here](gld_price_data.csv).

Attribute Information:<br>
1Ô∏è‚É£ `Date` <br>
2Ô∏è‚É£ `Price` <br>
3Ô∏è‚É£ `bedrooms` <br>
4Ô∏è‚É£ `bathroom` <br>
5Ô∏è‚É£ `sqft_living` <br>
6Ô∏è‚É£ `sqft_lot`<br>
7Ô∏è‚É£ `floors` <br>
8Ô∏è‚É£ `waterfront` <br>
9Ô∏è‚É£ `built` <br>
üîü `country`<br>

## Machine Learning Model:

1Ô∏è‚É£`LINEAR REGRESSION`

 Linear regression is a statistical method used to model and analyze the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a straight line through the data points to find the best-fitting line that minimizes the overall error. It aims to express the dependent variable as a linear function of the independent variable(s) and is widely employed for prediction and understanding the strength and direction of associations between variables in various fields<br>
 2Ô∏è‚É£ `SVM(SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE)`

 Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a powerful supervised machine learning algorithm for classification and regression tasks. It finds the best hyperplane to separate different classes by identifying support vectors, maximizing the margin between classes, and handling complex and nonlinear relationships. SVMs are versatile and widely used in various domains.<br>
